# JS BEGINNERS PROJECT: Change the Background Color

### Purpose

To practice fundamentals.  
To practice setting up an environment for TypeScript.  
To practice setting up an environment for TypeScript & Jest.  
To practice testing: what, why, how?

The `master` branch is a solution to the given problem.

Additional branches will progressively add TypeScript and Jest.

### WHAT I LEARNED OR WAS REMINDED OF BUILDING THIS VERSION

- The CommonJS module specification is the standard used in Node.js for working with modules. This is where the syntax `const someVar = require('someModuleOrFile')` comes from.

- Client-side JavaScript that runs in the browser uses another standard, called ES Modules. This is where the syntax `import someVar from 'someModuleOrFile'` comes from.

### NODE & COMMONJS MODULES

- Some

### THE BROWSER & ES MODULES

- You’ll need a server to be able to fetch with import, as it doesn’t work on the `file://` protocol. You can use npx serve to start up a server in the current directory for testing locally.

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve: to serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network)
