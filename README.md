# JS BEGINNERS PROJECT: Change the Background Color

### Purpose

To understand what adding a package does to a very simple app.  
To practice setting up an environment for TypeScript
To practice setting up an environment for TypeScript & Jest
To practice testing: what, why, how?

The `master` branch is a solution to the given problem.

Additional branches will progressively add TypeScript and Jest.

### WHAT I LEARNED OR WAS REMINDED OF BUILDING THIS VERSION

- Make sure you link your stylesheet in the html head. :)
- I learned about CSS variables. I hadn't used them before.
- I was reminded to double check your stylesheet for conflicting rules.
- I learned that `vh` & `vw` are better than using `%` for responsive design.
- I learned about the `String.replace()` method.
- I learned how to generate a random hexadecimal number.
- I learned that it's possible to use CSS variables to programmatically change a value in the stylesheet.
