# CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOR

This is a "vanilla" JavaScript project. By "vanilla" I mean that it uses no third party packages, and run in a browser as is. It doesn't need to be run on a server. It's made up of just html, css, and JavaScript.

I'll do my best to explain everything that's going on here as a foundation for progressively adding some common features you'll find in more complex JavaScript projects. I'll add TypeScript first so we have type checking - this is as close as you can get to "making" JavaScript strongly typed, like Golang, or C#, etc. Then I'll add Jest for testing our code.

Along the way we'll run into problems and explore new ideas like Node, modules, imports, exports, compilation, transpilation, and different versions of JavaScript (e.g. ES6 vs. ES5).
