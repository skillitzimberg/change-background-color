## WHAT I LEARNED OR WAS REMINDED OF BUILDING THIS VERSION

- Make sure you link your stylesheet in the html head. :)
- I learned about CSS variables. I hadn't used them before.
- I was reminded to double check your stylesheet for conflicting rules.
- I learned that `vh` & `vw` are better than using `%` for responsive design.
- I learned about the `String.replace()` method.
- I learned how to generate a random hexadecimal number.
- I learned that it's possible to use CSS variables to programmatically change a value in the stylesheet.
